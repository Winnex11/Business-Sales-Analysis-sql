# Business Sales Analysis Using SQL

## Project Overview
This project analyzes business sales data using SQL to uncover insights related to revenue trends, customer behavior, and overall business performance. The analysis demonstrates how structured queries can be used to answer real-world business questions and support data-driven decision-making.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to:
- Analyze sales performance across time and products
- Understand customer purchasing behavior
- Identify key drivers of revenue and growth
- Demonstrate practical SQL querying skills

## Dataset
- **Type:** Business Sales Dataset
- **Content:** Customer transactions, product information, sales revenue, and order details
- **Format:** Relational tables
- **Records:** Thousands of transaction-level records

> Note: Raw data files are not included in this repository. The dataset was provided for analytical practice and used solely for querying and insight generation.

## Tools Used
- SQL
- MySQL / PostgreSQL
- GitHub

## Analysis Approach
The analysis was carried out entirely using SQL queries, focusing on:
- Data filtering and aggregation
- Joins across multiple tables
- Time-based analysis
- Ranking and segmentation
- Revenue and performance metrics

## Key Business Questions
1. What is the total revenue generated over time?
2. Which products contribute the most to total sales?
3. Which customers generate the highest revenue?
4. How does sales performance vary by time period?
5. What trends can be observed in customer purchasing behavior?

## Key Insights
- A small group of top-performing products contributes a significant portion of total revenue.
- Repeat customers generate higher average revenue compared to one-time buyers.
- Sales show clear time-based trends, with peak periods driving overall performance.
- Customer segmentation highlights opportunities for targeted marketing and retention strategies.

## Business Value
The insights from this analysis can support:
- Revenue optimization strategies
- Customer retention and loyalty programs
- Inventory and demand planning
- Executive reporting and KPI tracking

## Limitations
- The dataset does not include detailed customer demographics.
- External factors influencing sales (marketing campaigns, promotions) were not available.
- Analysis is limited to historical transaction data.

## Future Improvements
- Integrate the results into a BI dashboard (Power BI or Tableau).
- Automate reporting queries for recurring analysis.
- Extend analysis to include profitability and cost metrics.
- Apply advanced SQL techniques such as window functions for deeper insights.
